# ðŸ’° Personal Spending Analysis with Forecasting

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of my personal expenses for 2024, aimed at gaining practical experience with key statistical techniques and understanding spending patterns. The dataset includes categorized monthly expenses that track different types of expenditures over the year.

Key components of the project include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, formatting issues, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing spending data to gain insights into overall spending habits and category-wise distribution.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations (pie charts and line graphs) to highlight spending trends and distributions.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Applying moving averages to track and forecast spending trends.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using Z-scores and confidence intervals to detect unusual spending patterns and assess consistency.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generating a summary report to provide insights into key findings, trends, and anomalies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **numpy**: Library used for numerical computing and statistical analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating charts and graphs.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment used to run the analysis.

## Statistical Techniques Applied

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Key metrics like total spending, category-wise distributions, and monthly totals.
- **Moving Averages**: To smooth monthly spending patterns and make trend analysis more consistent.
- **Trend Analysis**: Used to track the direction of spending over time.
- **Confidence Intervals**: To assess the reliability and variability in monthly spending data.
